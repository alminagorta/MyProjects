## Optimization Models
* A model to recommend [water allocation and invasive vegetation control]
* A model to recommend best management practices to [minimize water pollution]
## Machine Learning
* Clustering
** How to groups together Ontario fish species points with similar characteristics [K-means]
** Hierarchical clustering [Dendogram]
