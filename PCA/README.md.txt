# Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

* What is it? => PCA is a popular technique to transform a dataset onto a lower dimensional subspace for visualization and data exploration. 
* When can I use it? Use to:
  * Select relevant variables
  * Identify which variables are related each to other 
* How does it work?=> transform data to new coordinates system (more variance).Linear transformation is stretching the plane in 2 directions given by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In other words, takes a lot of dimensions and reduce it to 2 o 3 dimensions so we can look it
